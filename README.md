# Twilio GitHub Stats

This is a repository of GitHub OSPO Actions that pull stats that we can report on internally at Twilio.

## Actions

- Monthly Contributors: Produces information about the contributors, monthly, for our Twilio's public GitHub organizations.
- Issue Metrics: Gather metrics on Issues, PRs, and Discussions such as time to first response, count of issues opened, closed, and so on. Currently limited to twilio-node and sendgrid-nodejs as a trial.
- Stale Repo Watchtower: A monitor that watches for stale repositories so we can act on them, if needed.
- Retro Generator: A tool to generate a retro document from GitHub issues and PRs across Twilio's public GitHub organizations.


## Content

Currently content exists in two forms - issues and markdown files. This is a result of the actions used, not becuase one form is superior over the other. The formats will likely be merged in the future.
